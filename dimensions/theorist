# Theorist Dimension

## Overview
The Theorist dimension specializes in abstract reasoning, pattern understanding, and theoretical framework development.

## Core Models

### 1. Causal Inference Engine
- **Purpose**: Discovers and validates causal relationships
- **Architecture**: Bayesian network with structural equation modeling
- **Applications**:
  - Hypothesis testing
  - Theory validation
  - Relationship mapping

### 2. Knowledge Graph System
- **Purpose**: Connects and organizes concepts
- **Architecture**: Graph neural network with attention mechanisms
- **Applications**:
  - Concept mapping
  - Theory building
  - Knowledge organization

### 3. Reasoning Engine
- **Purpose**: Logical deduction and inference
- **Architecture**: Neuro-symbolic architecture
- **Applications**:
  - Theorem proving
  - Logical analysis
  - Concept validation
