# Pragmatist Dimension

## Overview
The Pragmatist dimension focuses on practical implementation, optimization, and real-world solution deployment.

## Core Models

### 1. Optimization Engine
- **Purpose**: Resource and process optimization
- **Architecture**: Multi-objective optimization with constraints
- **Applications**:
  - Resource allocation
  - Process improvement
  - Cost optimization

### 2. Reinforcement Learning System
- **Purpose**: Action-based learning and decision making
- **Architecture**: Actor-Critic with PPO
- **Applications**:
  - Policy optimization
  - Strategy development
  - Real-world deployment

### 3. Decision Systems
- **Purpose**: Practical decision making
- **Architecture**: Ensemble of decision trees and neural networks
- **Applications**:
  - Action planning
  - Implementation strategies
  - Risk management
