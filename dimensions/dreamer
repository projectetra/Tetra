  - Concept visualization

### 2. Story Generator
- **Purpose**: Creates narratives and scenarios
- **Architecture**: GPT-based architecture with narrative enhancement
- **Applications**:
  - Plot generation
  - Scenario planning
  - Creative writing

### 3. Vision Transformer
- **Purpose**: Visual understanding and generation
- **Architecture**: Modified ViT with generative capabilities
- **Applications**:
  - Image synthesis
  - Visual concept generation
  - Design exploration
